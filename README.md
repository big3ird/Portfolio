## [Project 1: Tack cycling and power performance analyser/race predictor shiny dashboard](https://github.com/big3ird/Portfolio/blob/main/Shiny_Dashboard.app)

* Ingest csv files and add tags/ variables to data from digital track cycling stop watch
* Caluculate kilometer times, total times and smoothness rating using lap splits
* Visualise lap times against planned scheduale (set lap times) for training and competition efforts 
* Visualise trends in mean maximal power development and compare with other athletes at same age
* Calculate race times and power requirements using enviromental conditions and other factors (rolling resistance, weight, avg of first lap power etc)
* Using power time curve relationship model and race caluclator, extract the mean maximal output for calcualted race duration.
