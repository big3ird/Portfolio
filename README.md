## [Project 1: Tack cycling and power performance analyser/race predictor shiny dashboard](https://github.com/big3ird/Portfolio/blob/main/Shiny_Dashboard.app)

* Ingest csv files and add tags/ variables to data from digital track cycling stopwatch
* Calculate kilometer times, total times and smoothness rating using lap splits
* Visualise lap times against planned schedule (set lap times) for training and competition efforts 
* Visualise trends in mean maximal power development and compare with other athletes at same age
* Calculate race times and power requirements using environmental conditions and other factors (rolling resistance, weight, avg of first lap power etc)
* Using power time curve relationship model and race calculator, extract the mean maximal output for the calculated race duration.
